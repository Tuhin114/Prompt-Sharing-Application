# Prompt Sharing Application

## Initial packages

- `npx create-next-app@latest ./`
- `npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth`

## Note 1

The code you provided sets up authentication in a Next.js application using NextAuth with Google as a provider. Here's a brief breakdown of what each part does:

1. **NextAuth Configuration**:

   - The `handler` function is defined using `NextAuth` with options that include the authentication providers (in this case, Google) and callbacks for handling sessions and sign-ins.
   - `GoogleProvider`: Uses `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables to authenticate users via Google.

2. **Callbacks**:
   - `session`: This callback is called whenever a session is checked. You can modify the session object before it's returned to the client.
   - `signIn`: This callback is triggered when a user signs in. You can use it to control the sign-in process, like checking if the user is allowed to sign in.

3. **Exports**:
   - The `handler` is exported for both `GET` and `POST` requests, making it easy to handle authentication via API routes in Next.js.

This setup gives you a foundation for integrating Google authentication in your Next.js app, while providing hooks to customize the authentication flow as needed.

## Note 2

This code snippet sets up a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose in a Node.js environment. It includes a mechanism to ensure that the database connection is only established once, which helps prevent multiple connections when the function is called multiple times. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Code Breakdown

1. **`isConnected` Variable**:
   - The `isConnected` variable is used to track whether the MongoDB connection has already been established. This prevents the application from attempting to connect to the database multiple times.

2. **`connectToDB` Function**:
   - **`mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);`**: This sets Mongoose's strict query option to true, ensuring that only defined schema paths are allowed in queries.
   - **Connection Check**: Before attempting a new connection, the function checks if `isConnected` is `true`. If so, it logs that MongoDB is already connected and exits the function early.
   - **`mongoose.connect`**: If not already connected, the function attempts to connect to MongoDB using the connection string from the environment variable `MONGODB_URI`. It also specifies a database name (`dbName: "share_prompt"`) and uses `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options to handle the MongoDB connection string and server discovery in a more robust way.
   - **Connection Success**: Upon successful connection, `isConnected` is set to `true`, and a success message is logged.
   - **Error Handling**: If the connection fails, the error is caught and logged to the console.

### Example Usage

You would typically call this `connectToDB` function at the start of your application's server-side code, ensuring that the database is connected before handling any requests that require database access.

### Improved Error Handling

For better maintainability, you might consider adding more detailed error handling or even retry logic in case of transient connection failures.

```js
try {
  await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
    dbName: "share_prompt",
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  });
  
  isConnected = true;
  console.log('MongoDB connected');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
  // Optionally add retry logic here
}
```

This setup ensures that your application efficiently handles database connections, avoiding unnecessary re-connections and potential performance issues.

## Note 3

This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a `User` in a MongoDB database, ensuring that user data adheres to specific validation rules. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Schema Definition (`UserSchema`)**:
   - **`email`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - **Unique**: The `unique: [true, 'Email already exists!']` constraint ensures that each email is unique in the database. If a duplicate email is attempted, it throws the error message "Email already exists!".
     - **Required**: The `required: [true, 'Email is required!']` constraint ensures that the email field must be provided. If not, the error message "Email is required!" is thrown.

   - **`username`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - **Required**: The `required: [true, 'Username is required!']` constraint ensures that the username field is mandatory. If not provided, the error message "Username is required!" is thrown.
     - **Match**: The `match` property contains a regular expression that enforces specific rules on the username:
       - The username must be between 8 and 20 characters.
       - It must be alphanumeric, allowing letters, numbers, underscores, and periods.
       - It cannot start or end with an underscore or period.
       - It cannot have consecutive underscores or periods.
       - If the username does not match this pattern, the error message "Username invalid, it should contain 8-20 alphanumeric letters and be unique!" is thrown.

   - **`image`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - This field is optional and can store a URL or path to the user's profile image.

2. **Model Definition (`User`)**:
   - The `models.User || model("User", UserSchema)` ensures that the `User` model is only created if it doesn't already exist. This is helpful in environments like Next.js, where modules may be hot-reloaded and models could be redefined multiple times.

3. **Export**:
   - The `User` model is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Usage Example

You can use this `User` model to create, read, update, and delete user documents in your MongoDB database. Here's a simple example of creating a new user:

```js
import User from './path/to/userModel';

const createUser = async () => {
  try {
    const newUser = await User.create({
      email: 'example@example.com',
      username: 'validUsername123',
      image: 'https://example.com/profile.jpg'
    });
    console.log('User created:', newUser);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', error.message);
  }
};
```

### Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Ensure that you handle potential validation errors properly when creating or updating users, as these constraints will throw errors if violated.
- **Schema Flexibility**: If you need to add more fields or customize the schema further, Mongoose allows you to do so easily by updating the `UserSchema`.

This setup is a solid foundation for handling user data in a MongoDB database, with built-in validation to ensure data integrity.

## Note 4

This code snippet extends the NextAuth authentication process by customizing the `session` and `signIn` callbacks to store additional user data and ensure user creation in the database if they don't already exist. Here's a breakdown of each callback:

### 1. **Session Callback**

- **Purpose**: To store the MongoDB user ID in the session.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Fetch User**: It fetches the user document from MongoDB by matching the user's email from the session (`session.user.email`).
  - **Store User ID**: The user's MongoDB `_id` is converted to a string and stored in the session object (`session.user.id`).
  - **Return Session**: The modified session object is returned, which will include the user's MongoDB ID.

   ```js
   async session({ session }) {
     // Fetch the user from the database
     const sessionUser = await User.findOne({ email: session.user.email });
     
     // Store the user's MongoDB ID in the session
     session.user.id = sessionUser._id.toString();
     
     return session;
   }
   ```

### 2. **SignIn Callback**

- **Purpose**: To handle user sign-in, including creating a new user in MongoDB if they do not already exist.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Database Connection**: First, it ensures a connection to the MongoDB database by calling `connectToDB()`.
  - **Check Existing User**: It checks if the user already exists in the database by searching for a document with the same email (`profile.email`).
  - **Create New User**: If the user does not exist, a new user document is created in MongoDB with the following details:
    - **Email**: Retrieved from the user's profile (`profile.email`).
    - **Username**: Generated by removing spaces from the user's name and converting it to lowercase (`profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase()`).
    - **Image**: The user's profile picture (`profile.picture`).
  - **Return True/False**: If everything succeeds, the callback returns `true`, allowing the sign-in to proceed. If there's an error, it logs the error message and returns `false`, preventing the sign-in.

   ```js
   async signIn({ account, profile, user, credentials }) {
     try {
       await connectToDB();

       // Check if user already exists
       const userExists = await User.findOne({ email: profile.email });

       // Create a new user if they don't exist
       if (!userExists) {
         await User.create({
           email: profile.email,
           username: profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase(),
           image: profile.picture,
         });
       }

       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       console.log("Error checking if user exists: ", error.message);
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```

### How It All Works Together

- **Session Callback**: Ensures that the session object contains the user's MongoDB ID, which can be useful for identifying the user in subsequent requests.
- **SignIn Callback**: Manages the sign-in process, ensuring that users are present in the database. If a user signs in for the first time, they are automatically added to MongoDB.

### Considerations4

- **Performance**: The `session` callback is called on every session check, so fetching the user from MongoDB each time could impact performance. You may want to optimize this by storing more information in the session object or implementing caching.
- **Error Handling**: The `signIn` callback includes basic error handling by returning `false` on failure, but you might want to expand this to handle different error scenarios or provide more user-friendly error messages.
- **Username Handling**: The username is generated by removing spaces and converting the user's name to lowercase. This might lead to conflicts or unexpected results, so consider enhancing the logic if needed.

## Note 5

This code snippet extends the NextAuth authentication process by customizing the `session` and `signIn` callbacks to store additional user data and ensure user creation in the database if they don't already exist. Here's a breakdown of each callback:

### 1. **Session Callback 5**

- **Purpose**: To store the MongoDB user ID in the session.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Fetch User**: It fetches the user document from MongoDB by matching the user's email from the session (`session.user.email`).
  - **Store User ID**: The user's MongoDB `_id` is converted to a string and stored in the session object (`session.user.id`).
  - **Return Session**: The modified session object is returned, which will include the user's MongoDB ID.

   ```js
   async session({ session }) {
     // Fetch the user from the database
     const sessionUser = await User.findOne({ email: session.user.email });
     
     // Store the user's MongoDB ID in the session
     session.user.id = sessionUser._id.toString();
     
     return session;
   }
   ```

    - **Image**: The user's profile picture (`profile.picture`).
  - **Return True/False**: If everything succeeds, the callback returns `true`, allowing the sign-in to proceed. If there's an error, it logs the error message and returns `false`, preventing the sign-in.

   ```js
   async signIn({ account, profile, user, credentials }) {
     try {
       await connectToDB();

       // Check if user already exists
       const userExists = await User.findOne({ email: profile.email });

       // Create a new user if they don't exist
       if (!userExists) {
         await User.create({
           email: profile.email,
           username: profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase(),
           image: profile.picture,
         });
       }

       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       console.log("Error checking if user exists: ", error.message);
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```

## Note 6

This code represents a React component called `CreatePrompt` that allows users to create a new prompt in a Next.js application. Here's a breakdown of how the component works:

### Component Breakdown

1. **`useClient` Directive**:
   - The `"use client"` directive at the top of the file indicates that this component is a client-side component in Next.js, which allows it to use hooks like `useState` and `useSession`.

2. **Imports**:
   - **`useState`**: A React hook for managing state within the component.
   - **`useSession`**: A hook provided by NextAuth to access the session data, including the authenticated user's information.
   - **`useRouter`**: A hook from Next.js for programmatic navigation.
   - **`Form`**: A custom component likely responsible for rendering the form UI used to create a new prompt.

3. **State Management**:
   - **`submitting`**: A state to manage the submission status. It's `true` while the form is being submitted and `false` otherwise.
   - **`post`**: An object state that holds the prompt and its associated tag. This is updated as the user fills out the form.

4. **`createPrompt` Function**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles the form submission to create a new prompt.
   - **Functionality**:
     - **Prevent Default**: `e.preventDefault()` prevents the default form submission behavior.
     - **Set Submitting**: Sets `submitting` to `true` to indicate that the form is being processed.
     - **API Call**: Sends a `POST` request to `/api/prompt/new` with the prompt data, including the prompt text, user ID (from the session), and tag.
     - **Response Handling**: If the response is successful (`response.ok`), the user is redirected to the home page (`router.push("/")`).
     - **Error Handling**: Logs any errors that occur during the request.
     - **Finally**: Resets the `submitting` state to `false` after the request completes.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - **Form Component**: The `Form` component is rendered, passing in the necessary props:
     - **`type='Create'`**: Likely indicates the form's purpose (in this case, creating a prompt).
     - **`post={post}`**: Passes the `post` state object to the form.
     - **`setPost={setPost}`**: Provides the `setPost` function to allow the form to update the `post` state.
     - **`submitting={submitting}`**: Passes the `submitting` state to indicate if the form is in the process of being submitted.
     - **`handleSubmit={createPrompt}`**: Passes the `createPrompt` function to handle the form submission.

### Usage Example

This component is designed to be used in a page or another component where users can create new prompts. When the user fills out the form and submits it, the prompt is sent to the server to be saved in the database.

### Considerations

- **Validation**: You might want to add validation for the form fields before submission to ensure the data is in the correct format.
- **User Feedback**: Consider adding user feedback (like a success message or error notification) after the form submission to enhance the user experience.
- **API Route**: Ensure that the `/api/prompt/new` API route exists and is correctly implemented to handle the incoming POST request and save the prompt data.

This component provides a functional and straightforward way to create new prompts, leveraging React state management and Next.js features like API routes and client-side navigation.

## Note 6

This `Form` component is a reusable React component that can be used for creating or editing prompts within your Next.js application. The component is highly customizable, allowing you to pass different props to control its behavior and appearance. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Component Breakdown

1. **Props**:
   - **`type`**: A string that indicates the action type (e.g., "Create" or "Edit"). This value is used to dynamically render text in the component.
   - **`post`**: An object containing the current prompt data (`prompt` and `tag`). This is used to populate the form fields.
   - **`setPost`**: A function to update the `post` state when the user makes changes to the form fields.
   - **`submitting`**: A boolean indicating whether the form is in the process of being submitted. This is used to disable the submit button and show a loading state.
   - **`handleSubmit`**: A function that handles form submission when the user clicks the submit button.

2. **Layout and Styling**:
   - The form is wrapped in a `<section>` with a flexbox layout, ensuring the content is aligned and spaced properly. It uses Tailwind CSS classes like `w-full`, `max-w-full`, and `flex-col` for layout styling.
   - The form uses a "glassmorphism" effect, likely achieved through custom Tailwind CSS styles or classes.

3. **Form Structure**:
   - **Heading**: Displays the action type (e.g., "Create Post" or "Edit Post") with a gradient style using the `blue_gradient` class.
   - **Description**: A brief description encouraging users to share their prompts.
   - **Textarea for Prompt**: A textarea input for the user to enter their AI prompt. The value is controlled by the `post.prompt` state, and updates are handled by the `setPost` function.
   - **Input for Tag**: A text input for the user to enter a tag for their prompt. Similar to the textarea, its value is controlled by the `post.tag` state.
   - **Action Buttons**:
     - **Cancel Link**: A link that navigates back to the home page (`'/'`).
     - **Submit Button**: A button that submits the form. It is disabled while the form is being submitted, and its text changes based on the `submitting` state (e.g., "Creating..." or "Create").

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `Form` component can be used within a parent component:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import Form from "./Form";

const CreatePostPage = () => {
  const [post, setPost] = useState({ prompt: "", tag: "" });
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setSubmitting(true);
    // Handle form submission logic here
    setSubmitting(false);
  };

  return (
    <Form
      type="Create"
      post={post}
      setPost={setPost}
      submitting={submitting}
      handleSubmit={handleSubmit}
    />
  );
};

export default CreatePostPage;
```

### Considerations

- **Accessibility**: The form is already fairly accessible with labels and proper form elements. You could enhance it further by adding `aria` attributes where necessary.
- **Validation**: Currently, the form fields are marked as `required`, but you might want to add additional validation logic for more complex requirements.
- **Styling Consistency**: Since you're using Tailwind CSS, ensure that custom styles like `blue_gradient` and `glassmorphism` are consistent across your project.

This component provides a flexible and reusable solution for creating and editing prompts, making it easy to integrate into different parts of your application.

## Note 7

This code defines an API route handler for the `POST` method in a Next.js application, where a new prompt is created and stored in the database. Below is a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Imports**:
   - **`Prompt`**: This is the Mongoose model for prompts. It is used to interact with the `Prompt` collection in the MongoDB database.
   - **`connectToDB`**: This utility function establishes a connection to the MongoDB database. It ensures that the database connection is open before attempting to save data.

2. **POST Function**:
   - **Purpose**: The function is an asynchronous handler for the `POST` HTTP method. It handles the creation of a new prompt in the database.
   
3. **Extracting Data**:
   - The `POST` function begins by extracting `userId`, `prompt`, and `tag` from the request's JSON body using `await request.json()`. This assumes that the incoming request body contains these fields.

4. **Database Connection**:
   - The `connectToDB()` function is called to ensure that there is an active connection to the MongoDB database before performing any operations. This function is designed to handle the connection logic and avoid redundant connections.

5. **Creating and Saving the Prompt**:
   - A new instance of the `Prompt` model is created using the data extracted from the request (`userId`, `prompt`, and `tag`). The `creator` field is set to `userId`, and `prompt` and `tag` are also passed.
   - The `newPrompt.save()` method is called to save the new prompt document to the MongoDB database.

6. **Response Handling**:
   - **Success**: If the prompt is successfully saved, the function returns a response with the newly created prompt serialized as JSON, along with a status code of 201 (Created).
   - **Error**: If an error occurs during the database operation, the function returns a response with an error message and a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error).

### Example Request:

This API route expects a `POST` request with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "tag": "#philosophy"
}
```

### Response Example:

- **Success**: On success, the response might look like:

  ```json
  {
    "_id": "64df8c0e9a9a9e2f8f6b9d3a",
    "creator": "user123",
    "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
    "tag": "#philosophy",
    "createdAt": "2024-08-19T12:34:56.789Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-08-19T12:34:56.789Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
  ```

- **Error**: On failure, the response might look like:

  ```text
  Failed to create a new prompt
  ```

### Considerations:

- **Validation**: Before creating a new prompt, consider adding validation to ensure that the `userId`, `prompt`, and `tag` are all valid and meet any necessary criteria (e.g., length, format).
- **Error Handling**: Currently, the error response is generic. You might want to provide more detailed error messages depending on the type of error (e.g., validation errors, database connection errors).
- **Security**: Ensure that `userId` is properly authenticated and authorized before allowing the creation of a new prompt to prevent unauthorized data creation.

This API route provides a straightforward way to create new prompts in your Next.js application, leveraging Mongoose for MongoDB operations.

## Note 8 
The `Feed` component is a core part of a Next.js application that fetches and displays a list of posts (prompts) with search and filter functionality. It also allows users to search for prompts by tag or username and dynamically updates the displayed list based on the search input.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **State Management**:
   - **`allPosts`**: Holds the list of all prompts fetched from the server.
   - **`searchText`**: Stores the current text entered in the search input.
   - **`searchTimeout`**: A timeout handler to implement a debounce function for the search input.
   - **`searchedResults`**: Holds the list of prompts filtered based on the search input.

2. **Fetching Posts**:
   - The `fetchPosts` function asynchronously fetches the prompts from the `/api/prompt` endpoint and updates the `allPosts` state.
   - This function is called within a `useEffect` hook, ensuring that the posts are fetched when the component mounts.

3. **Filtering Prompts**:
   - The `filterPrompts` function filters the `allPosts` array based on the `searchText`. It uses a case-insensitive regex to match the search text against the `username`, `tag`, or `prompt` fields of each post.

4. **Handling Search Input**:
   - **`handleSearchChange`**: This function is triggered whenever the user types in the search input. It clears any previous search timeout, sets a new timeout, and updates the `searchedResults` state after a 500ms delay (debounce). This helps reduce the number of filter operations performed while the user is still typing.
   
5. **Handling Tag Click**:
   - **`handleTagClick`**: When a tag is clicked, this function updates the search input and filters the prompts based on the clicked tag.

6. **Rendering the Feed**:
   - The component renders a search input field and a list of prompts.
   - Depending on whether there is search text, it either displays the filtered results (`searchedResults`) or all posts (`allPosts`).

### Component Structure:

- **`PromptCardList`**: A child component that renders the list of prompts. It receives the `data` (an array of prompts) and `handleTagClick` as props.
- **`PromptCard`**: A component used within `PromptCardList` to display individual prompt cards.

### Usage:

- **Search**: Users can type in the search bar to find prompts by username, tag, or prompt content. The search is debounced, so filtering only occurs after the user stops typing for 500ms.
- **Tag Click**: Users can click on tags within the prompts to filter the list by that specific tag.

### Considerations:

- **Performance**: The use of debouncing and regex-based search helps in managing performance, especially with large datasets.
- **User Experience**: The component provides a responsive search experience with instant feedback, making it user-friendly.
- **Scalability**: For large datasets, you might consider implementing server-side pagination or more advanced filtering techniques to avoid loading and filtering too much data on the client side.

This `Feed` component is versatile and provides essential features for content discovery within the application.

## Note 9

The `PromptCard` component is a UI element designed to display individual prompts or posts within the Next.js application. It includes functionalities for viewing the creator's profile, copying the prompt to the clipboard, and (if the user is the creator and is on their profile page) editing or deleting the prompt.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **State Management**:
   - **`copied`**: This state is used to temporarily store the prompt that has been copied to the clipboard. It helps in giving visual feedback to the user by toggling the copy icon.

2. **Handling Profile Click**:
   - **`handleProfileClick`**: Redirects the user to the profile page of the prompt's creator. If the creator is the logged-in user, it navigates to their own profile page (`/profile`). Otherwise, it directs to the profile page of the creator, identified by their user ID.

3. **Copy to Clipboard**:
   - **`handleCopy`**: Copies the prompt's text to the user's clipboard. After copying, it updates the `copied` state and changes the icon to indicate success. This change is reverted after 3 seconds.

4. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - The component conditionally renders the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons if the logged-in user is the creator of the prompt and the current page is the profile page (`/profile`).

5. **Event Handlers**:
   - **`handleEdit` and `handleDelete`**: These are callback functions passed as props to the component. They allow the parent component to define what happens when a user clicks "Edit" or "Delete."
   - **`handleTagClick`**: Another callback function that triggers when a tag is clicked. It allows filtering or searching based on the clicked tag.

### Component Structure:

- **Profile Information**:
  - Displays the creator's profile image, username, and email.
  - Clicking on the profile section directs the user to the creator's profile.

- **Copy Button**:
  - A small button that toggles between a copy icon and a tick icon based on whether the prompt has been copied.

- **Prompt and Tag**:
  - The main prompt text is displayed, followed by the tag associated with it. The tag is clickable and triggers the `handleTagClick` function if provided.

- **Edit and Delete Buttons**:
  - Only visible if the current user is the creator and they are viewing their own profile page. These buttons provide options to modify or remove the prompt.

### Usage:

- **Profile Navigation**: Users can navigate to the profile of the prompt's creator by clicking on their profile information.
- **Copy Functionality**: Easily copy the prompt text to the clipboard, with visual feedback indicating success.
- **Tag Filtering**: Tags are clickable, enabling quick filtering or searching of similar prompts based on tags.
- **Prompt Management**: The creator can edit or delete their prompt directly from the profile page.

### Considerations:

- **User Experience**: The component provides a clean and interactive UI, making it easy for users to manage and interact with prompts.
- **Scalability**: This component can be reused in different parts of the application, such as feeds, profile pages, or search results, making it versatile.
- **Performance**: The component is lightweight and uses minimal state management, ensuring it performs efficiently even when rendering multiple prompts in a list.

Overall, the `PromptCard` component is well-structured and offers essential functionalities for prompt management and interaction within the application.

## Note 10

The `GET` function you've implemented is an API route for fetching all prompts from the MongoDB database in your Next.js application. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Code Explanation:

1. **Database Connection**:
   - The function starts by connecting to the MongoDB database using `connectToDB()`. This ensures that the database connection is established before any operations are performed.

2. **Fetching Prompts**:
   - **`Prompt.find({})`**: This query fetches all prompt documents from the `Prompt` collection.
   - **`.populate('creator')`**: This method is used to populate the `creator` field in the `Prompt` documents. The `creator` field is a reference to the `User` model, and populating it replaces the reference with the actual `User` document, allowing you to access the creator's details (like username, email, etc.).

3. **Response Handling**:
   - **Success**: If the prompts are successfully fetched, the function returns a `Response` with a status of `200` and the JSON stringified prompts.
   - **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during the process (e.g., database connection fails or the query fails), a `500` status is returned with an error message indicating that the operation failed.

### Key Points:

- **`populate('creator')`**: This is important because it enriches the prompt data with the full `User` document corresponding to the `creator` field. This makes it easier to access creator details without additional queries.
  
- **Error Handling**: The try-catch block ensures that any issues during database connection or querying are caught, and a meaningful error response is sent back to the client.

- **HTTP Status Codes**:
  - **200 (OK)**: Indicates that the request was successful and the prompts were retrieved.
  - **500 (Internal Server Error)**: Indicates that there was an issue processing the request on the server.

### Usage:
This `GET` function is typically used in the `/api/prompt` route. When a client makes a GET request to this route, it will retrieve all prompts from the database, including the associated user data for the creator of each prompt.

### Example Usage in a Component:

If you were to fetch these prompts in a React component (like in the `Feed` component you've written), you would use this API route as follows:

```javascript
const fetchPosts = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/prompt");
    const data = await response.json();
    setAllPosts(data);
};
```

This would call the `GET` function, retrieve all the prompts, and then set the retrieved data in the component's state.

### Final Thoughts:
This API function is efficient and follows best practices by ensuring the database connection is made before querying and handling potential errors gracefully. It is an integral part of your prompt management system, enabling the frontend to display all available prompts to users.
