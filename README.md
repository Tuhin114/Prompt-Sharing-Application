# Prompt Sharing Application

## Initial packages

- `npx create-next-app@latest ./`
- `npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth`

## Note 1

The code you provided sets up authentication in a Next.js application using NextAuth with Google as a provider. Here's a brief breakdown of what each part does:

1. **NextAuth Configuration**:

   - The `handler` function is defined using `NextAuth` with options that include the authentication providers (in this case, Google) and callbacks for handling sessions and sign-ins.
   - `GoogleProvider`: Uses `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables to authenticate users via Google.

2. **Callbacks**:
   - `session`: This callback is called whenever a session is checked. You can modify the session object before it's returned to the client.
   - `signIn`: This callback is triggered when a user signs in. You can use it to control the sign-in process, like checking if the user is allowed to sign in.

3. **Exports**:
   - The `handler` is exported for both `GET` and `POST` requests, making it easy to handle authentication via API routes in Next.js.

This setup gives you a foundation for integrating Google authentication in your Next.js app, while providing hooks to customize the authentication flow as needed.

## Note 2

This code snippet sets up a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose in a Node.js environment. It includes a mechanism to ensure that the database connection is only established once, which helps prevent multiple connections when the function is called multiple times. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Code Breakdown

1. **`isConnected` Variable**:
   - The `isConnected` variable is used to track whether the MongoDB connection has already been established. This prevents the application from attempting to connect to the database multiple times.

2. **`connectToDB` Function**:
   - **`mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);`**: This sets Mongoose's strict query option to true, ensuring that only defined schema paths are allowed in queries.
   - **Connection Check**: Before attempting a new connection, the function checks if `isConnected` is `true`. If so, it logs that MongoDB is already connected and exits the function early.
   - **`mongoose.connect`**: If not already connected, the function attempts to connect to MongoDB using the connection string from the environment variable `MONGODB_URI`. It also specifies a database name (`dbName: "share_prompt"`) and uses `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options to handle the MongoDB connection string and server discovery in a more robust way.
   - **Connection Success**: Upon successful connection, `isConnected` is set to `true`, and a success message is logged.
   - **Error Handling**: If the connection fails, the error is caught and logged to the console.

### Example Usage

You would typically call this `connectToDB` function at the start of your application's server-side code, ensuring that the database is connected before handling any requests that require database access.

### Improved Error Handling

For better maintainability, you might consider adding more detailed error handling or even retry logic in case of transient connection failures.

```js
try {
  await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
    dbName: "share_prompt",
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  });
  
  isConnected = true;
  console.log('MongoDB connected');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
  // Optionally add retry logic here
}
```

This setup ensures that your application efficiently handles database connections, avoiding unnecessary re-connections and potential performance issues.

## Note 3

This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a `User` in a MongoDB database, ensuring that user data adheres to specific validation rules. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Schema Definition (`UserSchema`)**:
   - **`email`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - **Unique**: The `unique: [true, 'Email already exists!']` constraint ensures that each email is unique in the database. If a duplicate email is attempted, it throws the error message "Email already exists!".
     - **Required**: The `required: [true, 'Email is required!']` constraint ensures that the email field must be provided. If not, the error message "Email is required!" is thrown.

   - **`username`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - **Required**: The `required: [true, 'Username is required!']` constraint ensures that the username field is mandatory. If not provided, the error message "Username is required!" is thrown.
     - **Match**: The `match` property contains a regular expression that enforces specific rules on the username:
       - The username must be between 8 and 20 characters.
       - It must be alphanumeric, allowing letters, numbers, underscores, and periods.
       - It cannot start or end with an underscore or period.
       - It cannot have consecutive underscores or periods.
       - If the username does not match this pattern, the error message "Username invalid, it should contain 8-20 alphanumeric letters and be unique!" is thrown.

   - **`image`**:
     - **Type**: `String`
     - This field is optional and can store a URL or path to the user's profile image.

2. **Model Definition (`User`)**:
   - The `models.User || model("User", UserSchema)` ensures that the `User` model is only created if it doesn't already exist. This is helpful in environments like Next.js, where modules may be hot-reloaded and models could be redefined multiple times.

3. **Export**:
   - The `User` model is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Usage Example

You can use this `User` model to create, read, update, and delete user documents in your MongoDB database. Here's a simple example of creating a new user:

```js
import User from './path/to/userModel';

const createUser = async () => {
  try {
    const newUser = await User.create({
      email: 'example@example.com',
      username: 'validUsername123',
      image: 'https://example.com/profile.jpg'
    });
    console.log('User created:', newUser);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', error.message);
  }
};
```

### Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Ensure that you handle potential validation errors properly when creating or updating users, as these constraints will throw errors if violated.
- **Schema Flexibility**: If you need to add more fields or customize the schema further, Mongoose allows you to do so easily by updating the `UserSchema`.

This setup is a solid foundation for handling user data in a MongoDB database, with built-in validation to ensure data integrity.

## Note 4

This code snippet extends the NextAuth authentication process by customizing the `session` and `signIn` callbacks to store additional user data and ensure user creation in the database if they don't already exist. Here's a breakdown of each callback:

### 1. **Session Callback**

- **Purpose**: To store the MongoDB user ID in the session.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Fetch User**: It fetches the user document from MongoDB by matching the user's email from the session (`session.user.email`).
  - **Store User ID**: The user's MongoDB `_id` is converted to a string and stored in the session object (`session.user.id`).
  - **Return Session**: The modified session object is returned, which will include the user's MongoDB ID.

   ```js
   async session({ session }) {
     // Fetch the user from the database
     const sessionUser = await User.findOne({ email: session.user.email });
     
     // Store the user's MongoDB ID in the session
     session.user.id = sessionUser._id.toString();
     
     return session;
   }
   ```

### 2. **SignIn Callback**

- **Purpose**: To handle user sign-in, including creating a new user in MongoDB if they do not already exist.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Database Connection**: First, it ensures a connection to the MongoDB database by calling `connectToDB()`.
  - **Check Existing User**: It checks if the user already exists in the database by searching for a document with the same email (`profile.email`).
  - **Create New User**: If the user does not exist, a new user document is created in MongoDB with the following details:
    - **Email**: Retrieved from the user's profile (`profile.email`).
    - **Username**: Generated by removing spaces from the user's name and converting it to lowercase (`profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase()`).
    - **Image**: The user's profile picture (`profile.picture`).
  - **Return True/False**: If everything succeeds, the callback returns `true`, allowing the sign-in to proceed. If there's an error, it logs the error message and returns `false`, preventing the sign-in.

   ```js
   async signIn({ account, profile, user, credentials }) {
     try {
       await connectToDB();

       // Check if user already exists
       const userExists = await User.findOne({ email: profile.email });

       // Create a new user if they don't exist
       if (!userExists) {
         await User.create({
           email: profile.email,
           username: profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase(),
           image: profile.picture,
         });
       }

       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       console.log("Error checking if user exists: ", error.message);
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```

### How It All Works Together

- **Session Callback**: Ensures that the session object contains the user's MongoDB ID, which can be useful for identifying the user in subsequent requests.
- **SignIn Callback**: Manages the sign-in process, ensuring that users are present in the database. If a user signs in for the first time, they are automatically added to MongoDB.

### Considerations4

- **Performance**: The `session` callback is called on every session check, so fetching the user from MongoDB each time could impact performance. You may want to optimize this by storing more information in the session object or implementing caching.
- **Error Handling**: The `signIn` callback includes basic error handling by returning `false` on failure, but you might want to expand this to handle different error scenarios or provide more user-friendly error messages.
- **Username Handling**: The username is generated by removing spaces and converting the user's name to lowercase. This might lead to conflicts or unexpected results, so consider enhancing the logic if needed.

           username: profile.name.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase(),
           image: profile.picture,
         });
       }
