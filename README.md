# Prompt Sharing Application

## Initial packages

- `npx create-next-app@latest ./`
- `npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth`

## Note 1

The code you provided sets up authentication in a Next.js application using NextAuth with Google as a provider. Here's a brief breakdown of what each part does:

1. **NextAuth Configuration**:

   - The `handler` function is defined using `NextAuth` with options that include the authentication providers (in this case, Google) and callbacks for handling sessions and sign-ins.
   - `GoogleProvider`: Uses `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables to authenticate users via Google.

2. **Callbacks**:
   - `session`: This callback is called whenever a session is checked. You can modify the session object before it's returned to the client.
   - `signIn`: This callback is triggered when a user signs in. You can use it to control the sign-in process, like checking if the user is allowed to sign in.

3. **Exports**:
   - The `handler` is exported for both `GET` and `POST` requests, making it easy to handle authentication via API routes in Next.js.

This setup gives you a foundation for integrating Google authentication in your Next.js app, while providing hooks to customize the authentication flow as needed.
