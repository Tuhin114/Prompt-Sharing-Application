# Prompt Sharing Application

## Initial packages

- `npx create-next-app@latest ./`
- `npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth`

## Note 1

The code you provided sets up authentication in a Next.js application using NextAuth with Google as a provider. Here's a brief breakdown of what each part does:

1. **NextAuth Configuration**:

   - The `handler` function is defined using `NextAuth` with options that include the authentication providers (in this case, Google) and callbacks for handling sessions and sign-ins.
   - `GoogleProvider`: Uses `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables to authenticate users via Google.

2. **Callbacks**:
   - `session`: This callback is called whenever a session is checked. You can modify the session object before it's returned to the client.
   - `signIn`: This callback is triggered when a user signs in. You can use it to control the sign-in process, like checking if the user is allowed to sign in.

3. **Exports**:
   - The `handler` is exported for both `GET` and `POST` requests, making it easy to handle authentication via API routes in Next.js.

This setup gives you a foundation for integrating Google authentication in your Next.js app, while providing hooks to customize the authentication flow as needed.

## Note 2

This code snippet sets up a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose in a Node.js environment. It includes a mechanism to ensure that the database connection is only established once, which helps prevent multiple connections when the function is called multiple times. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Code Breakdown

1. **`isConnected` Variable**:
   - The `isConnected` variable is used to track whether the MongoDB connection has already been established. This prevents the application from attempting to connect to the database multiple times.

2. **`connectToDB` Function**:
   - **`mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);`**: This sets Mongoose's strict query option to true, ensuring that only defined schema paths are allowed in queries.
   - **Connection Check**: Before attempting a new connection, the function checks if `isConnected` is `true`. If so, it logs that MongoDB is already connected and exits the function early.
   - **`mongoose.connect`**: If not already connected, the function attempts to connect to MongoDB using the connection string from the environment variable `MONGODB_URI`. It also specifies a database name (`dbName: "share_prompt"`) and uses `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options to handle the MongoDB connection string and server discovery in a more robust way.
   - **Connection Success**: Upon successful connection, `isConnected` is set to `true`, and a success message is logged.
   - **Error Handling**: If the connection fails, the error is caught and logged to the console.

### Example Usage

You would typically call this `connectToDB` function at the start of your application's server-side code, ensuring that the database is connected before handling any requests that require database access.

### Improved Error Handling

For better maintainability, you might consider adding more detailed error handling or even retry logic in case of transient connection failures.

```js
try {
  await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
    dbName: "share_prompt",
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  });
  
  isConnected = true;
  console.log('MongoDB connected');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
  // Optionally add retry logic here
}
```

This setup ensures that your application efficiently handles database connections, avoiding unnecessary re-connections and potential performance issues.
